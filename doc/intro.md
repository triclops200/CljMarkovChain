# Introduction to markovchain

TODO: write [great documentation](http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/what-to-write/)

This is a random sentence generator which uses markov chains.
A number of text documents, provided to the generator, will
be parsed and then produce chains of how words are linked
together. From these, sentences can then be randomly generated.
